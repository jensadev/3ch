a hairy, 
a striped,  
a giant,  
a mad,  
a menacant, 
a shining,
a pale head,  
a white, 
a black, 
a wounded, 
a melancholic, 
a naked, 
a striped,  
a shiny eyed, 
a frightened, 
a crying, 
a tough,  
a violent, 
a dusty,  
an angry, 
a tattooed, 
a meditating, 
an atrocious, 
a bienvaillant, 
a noble, 
a horrified, 
a terrorized,  
a lunatic
