trough the night, 
at dawn, 
under the rain,  
in a factory, 
on top of a building, 
in a tunnel, 
in a prison, 
in a museum,
on the roofs of a city, 
in the sewers, 
in the subway,  
in a destroyed street,  
in front of a metal structure, 
on a bridge,  
in a hospital, 
in front of a huge building,
in a ghetto,  
in a casino,
in a pool 
on a highway,    
in a car park, 
in a cemetery,
in a supermarket,
in a destroyed street,  
in a bar, 
in the fog, 
under a bridge,  
in a street of shangai, 
in front of a river,
in a street of Tokyo, 
in front of a destroyed city,
in the middle of buildings, 
in a strip bar, 
in front of a panoramic view, 
in a loft,
in a pool,
in a wagon,
in a huge office,
in a dark street,
in front of a tank, 
in front of policemen,
in a taxi, 
in a gardens restaurant,
in a history museum,
in a gas station,
in a warehouse,
on stairs,
in  a tunnel
