in savanna, 
in the abyssals zone, 
in the desert, 
in the jungle, 
trough the night, 
in the twilight, 
at dawn, 
under the rain, 
in a dark forest, 
in snow, 
at the top of a mountain, 
on an enormous rock, 
aboard a ship, 
in space, 
on a beach, 
in a factory, 
on a green hill, 
on top of a building, 
in a tunnel, 
in a prison, 
in a cave, 
under a storm,
on the roofs of a city, 
in the sewers,
in weightlessness, 
on top of a chasm, 
in the malefic fog, 
(  (in black and white), 
manga style, 
on an oil platerforme, 
in a submarine, 
above the lava, 
in the subway, 
in a giant crystal forest, 
through the clouds, 
on a planet where storms are raging, 
in a lane, 
next to a waterfall, 
in a destroyed street, 
in a forest in autumn, 
in a cellar, 
in a pyramid, 
on a meteorite, 
in a black hole, 
in a forest of giant trees, 
on a wave, 
inbetween giant flowers, 
in a church, 
in a cemetery, 
in an asylum, 
on rails, 
in a chasm  in the storm, 
beside a tornado, 
in the night, 
in the stars, 
at the edge of the sea, 
in front of a metal structure, 
on a bridge, 
in a landscape of bubbles, 
on a wall, 
in a trench, 
in a temple, 
in a hospital, 
in a ghetto, 
in an air duct, 
in a casino, 
on a motorway, 
in a castle, 
in a marecage, 
on a paradisiac island, 
in fragments of glasses, 
beside a plane carcass, 
in a laboratory, 
in a polluted sea, 
in the clouds, 
on a water swirl, 
in  in a marsh, 
in orbit around a wild planet, 
in an apocalyptic landscape, 
on hills burned by the sun, 
in the vestiges of a lost civilization, 
in an unchained sea, 
on a bridge, 
at the bottom of a ravine, 
on a meteorite base, 
(in red), 
in a car park, 
in a supermarket, 
a parallel dimension, 
in hell, 
in an arctic cold, 
in the airs, 
in a deserted corridor, 
at school, 
in the fog, 
aboard a galion, 
on a silver cloud, 
through the ice-barrier, 
in a military environment, 
in a laundromat, 
in fast approach, 
in an old film, 
in a garage, 
in a laboratory, 
(monochromic), 
in a virtual universe, 
in a temple, 
in the flowers, 
in a crypt, 
in a devast�e street, 
in a crater, 
in a futuristic m�gapole, 
in an enormous spaceship, 
in a cemetery of wrecks, 
in an arena, 
in a field of meteorites, 
in a childish universe, 
in a bar, 
in the darkness, 
in a sauna, 
in a well, 
in the bayou, 
on a water lily, 
on a branch, 
on  a died tree, 
in the fog, 
under a bridge, 
in a drill covered with snow, 
along a a river, 
in the bamboos, 
at the edge of a cliff, 
in a arene, 
in the pampa, 
in a steampunk universe, 
on the ice-barrier, 
in an interior of day,
in an interior of night in a exterior of day, 
in an exterior of night, 
in an environment of fire, 
in a watery environment, 
in  an air environment, 
(fisheye lens), 
(looking down), 
(looking up), 
(seen by a monitoring camera ), 
on a paradisiac island  , 
on Mars, 
in a rice plantation, 
on a TV set, 
during a live performance, 
in a shipyard, 
in the ruins, 
in a dark mood, 
in the clouds, 
in smoking ruins, 
through a tornado, 
under the starlight night, 
in a western environment, 
in a street of shangai, 
in a street of Tokyo, 
in the middle of buildings, 
in a strip bar, 
in a glaucous bar, 
in a loft, 
in a circus, 
in fields, 
in an attic, 
in front of a mirror, 
in a stage, 
under the rain, 
in mushrooms, 
through brain neurons, 
in the vapor, 
in  a tunnel, 
in a source of hot water
